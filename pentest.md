# Penetration Test

Exploit all four targets. Any passwords come from customWordlist.txt used in prior assignments or from data sources in vulnerable servers in this assignment. Don't assume all that you see on the homepage is all that exists. Enumerate the targets.

Every target has vulnerabilities. Discover and exploit the vulnerabilities. Most vulnerabilities can be discovered externally (unauthenticated) but at least one may require internal (authenticated) enumeration.

Prepare and submit a report that:
1. Documents vulnerabilities
2. Documents exploits
3. Provides proof of successful exploitation

## October CMS

The user is admin. The password is a secret. Login as admin, get proof.

|Challenge|Description|Points|
|---|---|:-:|
|Challenge 1|Login as admin|10|

## Apache2

Sure it looks like nothing, but there are vulnerabilities. The end goal is to exploit the vulnerabilities. There's a bonus if you can get a shell.

|Challenge|Description|Points|
|---|---|:-:|
|Challenge 2|Directory enumeration|10|
|Challenge 3|LFI: Read /etc/passwd|10|
|Challenge 4|RCE: Discover hostname|10|
|Challenge 5|Extra-mile: shell|5|

## WordPress

It's loaded with vulnerabilities. There are multiple paths to earn the bonus. The bonus will be awarded for each path shown to get a shell.

|Challenge|Description|Points|
|---|---|:-:|
|Challenge 6|User enumeration|10|
|Challenge 7|Password attack on all users|10|
|Challenge 8|Authentication bypass|10|
|Challenge 9|LFI: Read /etc/passwd|10|
|Challenge 10|RCE: Discover hostname|10|
|Challenge 11|Extra-mile: shell|5|

## SQLi

SQLi can be a treasure trove. Take advantage.

|Challenge|Description|Points|
|---|---|:-:|
|Challenge 12|Current user and database|5|
|Challenge 13|Dump the current database|5|
|Challenge 14|Extra-mile: Discover and dump other database(s)|5|
